# Why the YoY Fluctuation ?
1. BUSINESS CONTEXT
Business Model

A healthy drinks & detox retail chain operating in Da Nang, Vietnam, specializing in detox juices and nutritious beverages.

After three years of operation, the business has built a stable customer base consisting of:

Local residents with a healthy lifestyle

Tourists visiting a major tourism city

Due to the nature of the market, sales data shows strong seasonality and clear changes in customer behavior over time.

Business Problem

Management needs:

A comprehensive review of growth performance

A deeper understanding of customer segments

Insights to optimize an increasingly complex product menu
